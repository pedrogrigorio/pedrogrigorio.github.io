          <h2>Kanto</h2>
          <p>Kanto is the first region in the Pokémon universe and in the popular series, games and anime. 
            It was then followed by Johto, Hoenn, Sinnoh, Unova, Kalos, Alola, Galar, and Paldea. It is 
            modeled and named after the Kantō region of Japan, which includes, amongst other cities, the 
            capital Tōkyō, where Game Freak is headquartered. Kanto is the only one that shares its name 
            with a real-world location. The resemblance between the bay formations seen on the in-game map 
            and the actual Sagami Bay, Suruga Bay, and Tokyo Bay formations is particularly striking. 
            Kanto also has some elements of Chūbu.

          <h2>Johto</h2>
          <p>The Johto region (Japanese: ジョウト地方 Johto region) is a region of the Pokémon world. Johto 
            is located west of Kanto, which together form a joint landmass that is south of Sinnoh and 
            Sinjoh Ruins.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was the second core series region to be introduced. First explored in Pokémon Gold and Silver,
            it is home to an additional 100 Pokémon that were not present in the previous games. It is also 
            the setting of Pokémon Crystal, Pokémon HeartGold, and Pokémon SoulSilver.
